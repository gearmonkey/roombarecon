These are the python scripts driving the Roomba Recon playlist generator.

~~System is live here: http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~map01bf/recon/playlist~~

If you're going to try this on another install you'll need a soundcloud api key and an echonest API key

Also, to get usable results, you'll need to build a small idf sample.  This can be done by running the populate_idf.py script for a few hours.
